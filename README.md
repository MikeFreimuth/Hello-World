# Hello-World

'''
I am posting some things that I have been working on here for potential employers to check out.  Currently, there is a random forest for predicting housing prices using data from Kaggle and several RL algorithms from an assignment from David Silver's class (all the "Easy21" files).  I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement in these but I think they show that I can get my mind around a complex algorithm 
and produce functional code.  Thanks for looking!
